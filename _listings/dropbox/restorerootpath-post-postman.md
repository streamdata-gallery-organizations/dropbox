You can switch the `path_prefix` on any existing cursor to a descendant of the\nexisting `path_prefix` on subsequent calls to `/delta`. For example if your cursor has no `path_prefix`,\nyou can switch to any `path_prefix`. If your cursor has a `path_prefix` of \"/Photos\", you can switch it\nto \"/Photos/Vacaction\".\n\nWhen `include_media_info` is specified, files will only appear in delta responses when the media info is\nready. If you use the `include_media_info` parameter, you must continue to pass the same value on subsequent\ncalls using the returned cursor.\n\n**Important:** Unfortunately it is not possible to model correct Dropbox response with Swagger specification,\ndue to [nested array](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/40) usage in delta response.\n\nSuccessful result [will return](https://gist.github.com/ando-takahiro/5203137) an array of delta `entries`.\nEach delta entry is a 2-item list of one of the following forms:\n\n  * `[, ]` - Indicates that there is a file/folder at the given path. You should add the entry\n  to your local state. The metadata value is the same as what would be returned by the `/metadata` call, except\n  folder metadata doesn't have `hash` or `contents` fields. To correctly process delta entries:\n    * If the new entry includes parent folders that don't yet exist in your local state, create those parent\n    folders in your local state.\n    * If the new entry is a file, replace whatever your local state has at path with the new entry.\n    * If the new entry is a folder, check what your local state has at ``. If it's a file, replace it\n    with the new entry. If it's a folder, apply the new `` to the folder, but don't modify the\n    folder's children. If your local state doesn't yet include this path, create it as a folder.\n    * If the new entry is a folder with the `read-only` field set to `true`, apply the read-only permission\n    recursively to all files within the shared folder.\n  * `[, null]` - Indicates that there is no file/folder at the given path. To update your local state\n  to match, anything at path and all its children should be deleted. Deleting a folder in your Dropbox will\n  sometimes send down a single deleted entry for that folder, and sometimes separate entries for the folder\n  and all child paths. If your local state doesn't have anything at path, ignore this entry.\n\n**Note:** Dropbox treats file names in a case-insensitive but case-preserving way. To facilitate this,\nthe `` values above are lower-cased versions of the actual path. The last path component of the\n`` value will be case-preserved."
