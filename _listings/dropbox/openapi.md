      summary: A long-poll endpoint to wait for changes on an account.
      description: |-
        A long-poll endpoint to wait for changes on an account. In conjunction with [/delta](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#delta),
        this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an account for file changes.

        Note that this call goes to **api-notify.dropbox.com** instead of *api.dropbox.com*.

        Unlike most other API endpoints, this call does not require OAuth authentication. The passed in `cursor` can
        only be acquired via an authenticated call to [/delta](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#delta).
