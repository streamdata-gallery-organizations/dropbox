For example, if your app processes future delta entries\nand sees that a folder was deleted, your app won't know what files were in that folder. Use this endpoint\nif your app only needs to know about new files and modifications and doesn't need to know about files that\nalready exist in Dropbox.\n\nIf you need to build local state to match the server state in Dropbox, you should instead use `/delta`.",
