  /delta:
    post:
      summary: A way of letting you keep up with changes to files and folders in a
        user's Dropbox.
      description: |-
        A way of letting you keep up with changes to files and folders in a user's Dropbox.

        You can periodically call `/delta` to get a list of "delta entries", which are instructions on how to
        update your local state to match the server's state.

        If you use the `path_prefix` parameter, you must continue to pass the correct prefix on subsequent calls
        using the returned cursor. You can switch the `path_prefix` on any existing cursor to a descendant of the
        existing `path_prefix` on subsequent calls to `/delta`. For example if your cursor has no `path_prefix`,
        you can switch to any `path_prefix`. If your cursor has a `path_prefix` of "/Photos", you can switch it
        to "/Photos/Vacaction".

        When `include_media_info` is specified, files will only appear in delta responses when the media info is
        ready. If you use the `include_media_info` parameter, you must continue to pass the same value on subsequent
        calls using the returned cursor.

        **Important:** Unfortunately it is not possible to model correct Dropbox response with Swagger specification,
        due to [nested array](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/issues/40) usage in delta response.

        Successful result [will return](https://gist.github.com/ando-takahiro/5203137) an array of delta `entries`.
        Each delta entry is a 2-item list of one of the following forms:

          * `[, ]` - Indicates that there is a file/folder at the given path. You should add the entry
          to your local state. The metadata value is the same as what would be returned by the `/metadata` call, except
          folder metadata doesn't have `hash` or `contents` fields. To correctly process delta entries:
            * If the new entry includes parent folders that don't yet exist in your local state, create those parent
            folders in your local state.
            * If the new entry is a file, replace whatever your local state has at path with the new entry.
            * If the new entry is a folder, check what your local state has at ``. If it's a file, replace it
            with the new entry. If it's a folder, apply the new `` to the folder, but don't modify the
            folder's children. If your local state doesn't yet include this path, create it as a folder.
            * If the new entry is a folder with the `read-only` field set to `true`, apply the read-only permission
            recursively to all files within the shared folder.
          * `[, null]` - Indicates that there is no file/folder at the given path. To update your local state
          to match, anything at path and all its children should be deleted. Deleting a folder in your Dropbox will
          sometimes send down a single deleted entry for that folder, and sometimes separate entries for the folder
          and all child paths. If your local state doesn't have anything at path, ignore this entry.

        **Note:** Dropbox treats file names in a case-insensitive but case-preserving way. To facilitate this,
        the `` values above are lower-cased versions of the actual path. The last path component of the
        `` value will be case-preserved.

        A way to quickly get a cursor for the server's state, for use with `/delta`.

        Unlike `/delta`, `/delta/latest_cursor` does not return any entries, so your app will not know about any
        existing files or folders in the Dropbox account. For example, if your app processes future delta entries
        and sees that a folder was deleted, your app won't know what files were in that folder. Use this endpoint
        if your app only needs to know about new files and modifications and doesn't need to know about files that
        already exist in Dropbox.

        If you need to build local state to match the server state in Dropbox, you should instead use `/delta`.

        Similar to [/shares](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#shares). The difference is that this

        the contents of your media. This URL should not be used to display content directly in the browser.

        The `/media` link expires after four hours, allotting enough time to stream files, but not enough to leave

      summary: Returns a list of all shared folders.
      description: |-
        Returns a list of all shared folders the authenticated user has access to.

        This API call requires Full Dropbox or File type [permissions](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/devguide#app-permissions).

        Note that `same_team` is only present if the linked account is a member of a Dropbox for Business team,
        and `member_id` is only present when this endpoint is called by a Dropbox for Business app and the user
        is on that team.

        The `membership` field only contains users who have joined the shared folder and does not include users who
        have been invited but have not accepted. When the `active` field is `false`, it means that a user has left
        a shared folder (but may still rejoin).
